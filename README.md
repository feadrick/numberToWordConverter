# numberToWordConverter
#project folder description<br/>
1.CoreConverter is the core logic for number to word convertion<br>
2.ConverterUnitTest is test file to test the convertion<br>
3.NumberToWordConverter is the project using .net 7 and this is ASP .NET CORE WEB APP (Model-View-Controller)<br>

#Approach Reason<br/>
1.The reason i create multiple project is to make sure that the code tested by creating unit test project ,and separating the core logic from web application,<br/>
by using this approach, the core logic can be extended and used into other application if in future i need to add another project on different platform such as WPF or Window form.
